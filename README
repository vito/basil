= Responsibilities

== advertising capacity

  Basil will be configured with the total capacity of the VM containing the
  colocated DEA, sshark agent, and stager. It will look at the usage of the
  3 components, and compute availability from this.

  DEA:
    dea.advertise: stack, available memory, app instance counts

  sshark:
    ssh.advertise: stack, available memory

  staging:
    staging.advertise: stack, available memory


== router registration

  Basil will watch the state of the 3 components for changes to their routes,
  and be sure to register them on an interval, and unregister them when they
  go away. It will use fsnotify to immediately see changes.

  DEA:
    router.register for applications configured with URIs.
    router.unregister when it sees a route or instance disappear

  sshark:
    router.register for sessions, with the session GUID as the host
    router.unregister when it sees a session go away
